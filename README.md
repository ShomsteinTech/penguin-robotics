This is where the code for the robot will be hosted.

//Alright -- I hope this is how you comment in C

boolean on = false;
boolean armMoving = false;
boolean ShitSpining = false;
boolean Wheels = false;
boolean reverseTies = false;
float rpmArm = //figure this out;
float rpmWheels = //figure this out too;

//EVERYTHING GOES HERE (BELOW)

while (on) {
  //Turn motors on :)
  while (button press (x or something)) {
    //make zipties reverse!
    //make arm move up at a certain speed (look up for variable) for loop maybe
    ReverseTies = true;
  }
  
}
